My goals for Phaser Plus are to enrich the list of tutorials, plugins, and extensions for Phaser and also to simplify the process of developing games.\\n\\nCurrently, Phaser Plus offers a project creation tool, debugger, an extension for creating isometric games and a guide for building larger projects.\\n\\n# What is next ?\\n\\nIn the future, I plan to continue developing Phaser Plus and adding more useful features and tools. Some ideas I have for future development include:\\n - Split screen feature\\n - Tool for creating audio sprites\\n - Utilities and helpers for common game features\\n\\nI hope you find Phaser Plus helpful and that it makes your game development process more efficient and enjoyable. If you have any suggestions or ideas for future development, please don\'t hesitate to reach out and [let me know](https://github.com/kalevski/phaser-plus/discussions)!"}]}')}}]);
